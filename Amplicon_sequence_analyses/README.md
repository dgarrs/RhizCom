The R script provided (.Rmd) contains the code used to analyze the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). 
ASV sequences and taxonomy tables are included and were obtained following the DADA2 pipeline for the analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences, as previously described (Garrido-Sanz et al. Microbiome 11, 214. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-023-01660-5).
The medatadata table and surviving sequences throughout the DADA2 pipeline files are also included.
CFUs tracked throughout the experiment are available in the file "RhizCom_CFUs.txt".
