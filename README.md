# RhizCom - Rhizosphere Community microbiome assembly during sequential succession

R scripts of the analyses used in Garrido-Sanz et al., "Priority effects of heritable seed-borne bacteria drive early assembly of the wheat rhizosphere microbiome". Preprit available in BioRxiv.

Raw 16S rRNA amplicon reads and metagenome sequencing data are vailable in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (RSA) under BioProject accession number [PRJNA1169405](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1169405).

Files include.
1. Amplicon sequence analysis: R script, metadata, ASV sequence table, taxonomy table, and CFUs.
2. Metagenome analyses: R script. 

Other data used in the study and procesed data can be found in the supplementary material of the paper.
