# RhizCom - Rhizosphere Community microbiome assembly during sequential succession

R scripts for the analyses used in Garrido-Sanz et al., "Priority effects of heritable seed-borne bacteria drive early assembly of the wheat rhizosphere microbiome". Preprint available on [BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.21.619384).

Raw 16S rRNA amplicon reads and metagenome sequencing data are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (RSA) under BioProject accession number [PRJNA1169405](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1169405).

Files include.
1. Amplicon sequence analysis: R script, metadata, ASV sequence table, taxonomy table, and CFUs.
2. Metagenome analyses: R script. 

Other data used in the study and processed data can be found in the supplementary material of the paper.
