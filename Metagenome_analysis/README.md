The R script for analyzing the metagenomes of samples included in this project contains:
1. Filtering and processing of reads. Includes the removal of host (wheat) reads, normalization and binning of reads by k-mer coverage.
2. Sample coverage based on sequence diversity.
3. Coassembly
4. Functional annotation
5. Functional analysis

In addition, files "MAGS_info.txt" and "DESeq_KEGG_subset.txt" manually generated are also provided.
