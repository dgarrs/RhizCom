The R script (.Rmd) for the analysis of the metagenomes of the samples included in this project contains:
1. Read filtering and processing. Includes removal of host (wheat) reads, normalization, and binning of reads by k-mer coverage.
2. Sample coverage based on sequence diversity.
3. Coassembly.
4. Functional annotation.
5. Functional analysis.

In addition, manually generated files "MAGS_info.txt" and "DESeq_KEGG_subset.txt" are provided.
